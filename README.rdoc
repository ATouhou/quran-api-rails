## Elasticsearch
It's painful. But this will help a lot:

* Web portal: sudo plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head
		* Git: https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head
		* `open http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/`
* To view all indices
		* http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
* Problems with indices or routing? (RoutingMissingException)
		* Delete the index
		* http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-delete-index.html
